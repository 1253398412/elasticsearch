<<query-dsl-distance-feature-query,`distance_feature` query>>::
Boosts the <<relevance-scores, relevance score>> of documents closer to a

efficiently skip non-competitive hits.

Boosts the <<relevance-scores, relevance score>> of documents based on the
numeric value of a <<rank-feature,`rank_feature`>> or
<<rank-features,`rank_features`>> field. You can use `rank_feature` query to
efficiently skip non-competitive hits.

<<query-dsl-script-query,`script` query>>::
Filters documents based on a provided <<modules-scripting-using,script>>.

<<query-dsl-script-score-query,`script_score` query>>::
