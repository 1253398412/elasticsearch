== Full-text queries

You can use full-text queries to search <<text,`text`>> fields. Text fields
typically store human-readable, unstructured text, such as the body of an email
or a product description.

To better store text for retrieval, {es} changes `text` field values into
individual words, called <<analysis-tokenizers, tokens>>, during a process
called <<analysis,analysis>>. For example, the default
<<analysis-standard-analyzer, standard analyzer>> changes make the following
changes to a text:

* Removes most punctuation
* Separates the remaining text into tokens
* Changes the tokens to lowercase

To match this analyzed text, full-text queries also analyze the search terms you
provide before performing a search. This means full-text queries can search
`text` fields for analyzed tokens rather than an exact term, like term-level
queries. See <<avoid-term-query-text-fields>> for an example.

[[full-text-query-types]]
=== Types of term-level queries

<<query-dsl-intervals-query,`intervals` query>>::
Returns documents based on the order and proximity of matching terms.

<<query-dsl-match-query,`match` query>>::
+
--
Returns documents that match an analyzed text, number, or date.

The `match` query is the standard query for performing a full-text search,
including options for fuzzy matching.
--

<<query-dsl-match-bool-prefix-query,`match_bool_prefix` query>>::
Returns documents that match an analyzed text. {es} treats the last
term of the provided text as a <<query-dsl-prefix-query,prefix>>, matching any
words that begin with that term.

<<query-dsl-match-query-phrase,`match_phrase` query>>::
Returns documents that contain all words of a provided text, in the same
order as provided.
    
<<query-dsl-match-query-phrase-prefix,`match_phrase_prefix` query>>::
Returns documents that contain the words of a provided text, in the same
order as provided. {es} treats the last term of the provided text as a
<<query-dsl-prefix-query,prefix>>, matching any words that begin with that term.
  
<<query-dsl-multi-match-query,`multi_match` query>>::
Returns documents that match an analyzed text, number, or date in
one or more fields. You can use the `multi-match` query to perform a
<<query-dsl-match-query,`match`>> search across multiple fields.

<<query-dsl-query-string-query,`query_string` query>>::
Returns documents based on a provided query string, using parser with a strict
syntax. While versatile, the `query_string` query returns an error if the query
string includes any invalid syntax.

<<query-dsl-simple-query-string-query,`simple_query_string` query>>::
Returns documents based on a provided query string, using a parser with a
limited but fault-tolerant syntax. Unlike the `query_string` query, the
`simple_query_string` query ignores invalid syntax instead of returning an
error.
